It's never impossible.\r\n          <br/>\r\n          The thought that's messing up my mind is the fact that I don't know exactly when to start and finish each task.<br/><br/>\r\n          To make it easier, I write down my task in details and the time I expect it to be finished.\r\n          If I feel like my task is too big, I break it down to the point that I can handle it in the next 4 hours at most.<br/><br/>\r\n          If I am overwhelmed by a task that is coming up and I get demotivated,\r\n          I tell my co-workers, friends or family about it and how I think I will be dealing with it in details.\r\n          That will make me realize, that my brain is only overwhelmed by my fantasy.\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <strong style={{ fontFamily: \"Arial\" }}>2: Stay exactly where you are</strong><br/>\r\n          Issue: Suddenly lose concentration and a 'little break' never ends\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          It's not about a lunch break or actual rest for your eyes and hands,\r\n          it's mainly about being on the phone, scrolling through your favorite social media, watching videos or playing mobile games.<br/><br/>\r\n          I learned that if I get tempted to touch my phone I should just do it. \r\n          Once I'm out of focus it's really hard to let the temptation go away and it only makes me more distracted.<br/><br/>\r\n          My solution is very specific. I should not stand up and go somewhere to take a break. Instead, \r\n          I stay exactly where I work, keep one of my hands on the laptop and make sure I can go back to work as soon as I want.\r\n          Then I can put my phone on the desk and do whatever I want to do.\r\n          (I don't recommend to use the same laptop you work with to have a little break)<br/><br/>\r\n          Since I never stop thinking about working this way, I end up going back to work after a few minutes.\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <strong style={{ fontFamily: \"Arial\" }}>3.

Kick the chair and stand up. I know it's scary to lose what is in your mind.\r\n          But trust me by doing so you can get out of your state temporarily and it's not that hard to go back to what you were doing afterwards.\r\n        </h4>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <Link to=\"/\">Go back to top</Link>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default SecondPage\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
